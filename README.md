The application is about NYC trees and parks. I used two data, trees data and parks data, to build the app.
There're three pages, a map where users can find parks area and trees in NYC, and they can customerize the map by selecting boroughs and tree diameter at breast height (d.b.h.). The second page consists of two plots showing distribution of tree diameter at breast height by species and health condition by species. Users can customerize the plots by selecting health condition and council district. The third page is a table. The data are extracted from trees data, and users can download them.
